# DBMS & SQL Documentation

## Overview

This repository serves as a structured knowledge base for studying and revising Database Management Systems (DBMS) and SQL. It consolidates theoretical foundations, relational modeling principles, and practical SQL operations into a single, version-controlled resource. The content is optimized for clarity, long-term reference, and integration into academic or project workflows.

## Objectives

* Maintain modular and accessible documentation of DBMS concepts.
* Capture SQL syntax, patterns, and edge-case behaviours in a consistent format.
* Provide executable schemas, sample queries, and small practice datasets.
* Build a reusable reference suitable for coursework, interviews, and system design work.

## Contents

The documentation covers:

* **DBMS Architecture:** data models, schema design, relational integrity, and functional dependencies.
* **Normalization:** 1NF through BCNF, decomposition strategies, and dependency preservation.
* **SQL Fundamentals:** DDL, DML, DQL; aggregate functions; filtering; grouping; pattern matching.
* **Advanced SQL:** joins, nested and correlated subqueries, indexing strategies, and view design.
* **Procedural Extensions:** stored procedures, functions, triggers, and transactional control.
* **Practice Material:** ready-to-run schemas, queries, and exam-oriented exercises.

## How to Use

1. Begin with *01-dbms-basics* for foundational understanding.
2. Move to *02-sql-basics* to build operational SQL familiarity.
3. Use *03-advanced-sql* to explore higher-level constructs and optimization-aware patterns.
4. Run the files in *04-practice* in your SQL environment to reinforce concepts.
5. Refer to *05-cheatsheets* for quick revision during exams or interviews.

## Tools & Environment

* SQL Engine: MySQL / PostgreSQL
* Editor: VS Code / JetBrains DataGrip
* Version Control: Git & GitHub

## Status

This repository is actively updated as part of ongoing study and consolidation efforts. Additional notes, examples, and topic expansions will be added progressively.
